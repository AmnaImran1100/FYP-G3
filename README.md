# FYP-G3
We are aiming to design a project which will target the students of O Levels and A Levels specifically. We want to optimize the learning and exam preparation phases for students in such a way that it would save their time and manual labor. The project would focus on making the “Yearly” and “Topicals” Past Papers and Marking Schemes available on the same website and trainging the website on them, in order to provide students with AI prompts where they can ask academic related or questions from past papers and generate past papers on the existing pattern, moreover pdf notes and books would also be available on the website for the students to refer.
